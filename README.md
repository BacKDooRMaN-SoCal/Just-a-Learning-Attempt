# Just-a-Learning-Attempt
Hoping to learn a few things, just for the sake of learning. Not necessarily to ever be used.
I'd like to learn programming but have yet to follow through on teaching myself or Finding someone to help,or taken any types of classes.
I've spent most my younger years (from 21 to 40) doing Network Desktop Support for companies such as Intel, Honeywell,Allied Signal & others. All self taught. So I know I could do it if I'd just make a true effort, especially if given direction, pointers or insight or even help.

Best Wishes to All
